* Overview
Provides a means to:
- save org entries in couchdb
- edit couchdb entries with org mode

* Idea
- provide mapping between org entries (not files) and couchdb documents
- an entry with an id (TBD: choose if org-mode id is enough, or
  special couchdb id is needed) corresponds to a couch db document
- couchdb fields are generally treated as item properties
- prime way to identify items is via tags
- flexible configuration by just providing properties, using org's
  property inheritance
- structure of org files is independent of couchdb documents, as the
  latter are only stored flat on the server
- directives allow to generate org tree structures based on tag
  queries
